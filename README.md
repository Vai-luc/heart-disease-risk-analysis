# heart-disease-risk-analysis
This project investigates the correlation between various health-related factors and the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset of 300 anonymized patients, both with and without heart disease. The goal is to identify key indicators that contribute to heart disease risk through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

Using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, the data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to uncover statistical patterns. Visualization tools like Seaborn and hvPlot were used to represent relationships and highlight critical features. Graphs such as box plots, grouped bar charts, histograms, and line graphs with best-fit lines were employed to bring out visual insights clearly and effectively.

Key findings from the analysis show that patients between the ages of 45â€“65, particularly males experiencing atypical anginal, non-anginal, or asymptomatic chest pains, exhibit a higher probability of having heart disease. These patients often display a max heart rate exceeding 150, and a decreasing slope in the ST segment. Interestingly, cholesterol levels did not emerge as a strong predictor in this specific sample.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, feature analysis, and exploratory data visualization, while also providing interpretable conclusions that could inform further research or health-related decision-making. All visualizations and code are well-documented for reproducibility and clarity.
